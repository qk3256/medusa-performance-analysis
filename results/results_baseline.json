ASSISTANT: Debt consolidation is a process of combining multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, typically with the goal of simplifying debt repayment and reducing overall interest costs. Here's a step-by-step overview of how debt consolidation typically works:\n\n1. Assess your debts: Review your current debts, including credit card balances, personal loans, and other unsecured debts. Determine the total amount owed and the interest rates for each debt.\n2. Research debt consolidation options: Explore various debt consolidation options, such as a personal loan, a home equity loan, or a debt management plan (DMP) through a credit counseling agency.\n3. Apply for a consolidation loan: If you choose a personal loan or a home equity loan, apply for a new loan with a lower interest rate. This new loan will be used to pay off your existing debts.\n4. Consolidate your debts: Once approved, use the funds from the new loan to pay off your existing debts. Make sure to pay off high-interest debts first",
